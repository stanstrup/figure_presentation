## Introduction

Heatmaps are powerful tools for visualizing high-dimensional data, but they're easily ruined by outliers. This chapter covers strategies for robust heatmap scaling.

## Coming Soon

This chapter is being developed. Key topics will include:

- The outlier problem in heatmaps
- Z-score vs MAD scaling
- Quantile capping
- Row vs column scaling
- When to use each approach

For now, refer to the [presentation slides](../../presentation.html#heatmap-scaling) for this content.
