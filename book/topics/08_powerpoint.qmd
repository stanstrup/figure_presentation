## Introduction

One of the most common ways to ruin a perfectly good R plot is to copy-paste it into PowerPoint. This creates low-resolution bitmaps that look terrible when projected. This chapter teaches you the proper workflow for inserting high-quality plots into presentations.

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will:

- Understand why copy-paste creates low-quality plots
- Know the correct workflow: save first, insert second
- Learn optimal formats for PowerPoint (PNG at 150 DPI, SVG)
- Be able to ungroup SVG elements for editing in PowerPoint
- Understand the trade-offs between PNG and SVG for presentations

## The Copy-Paste Problem

**What happens when you copy from RStudio:**

::: {.incremental}
- Pastes as low-resolution bitmap
- Looks OK on screen (72 DPI)
- **Terrible when projected**
- Pixelated and blurry
- Doesn't scale well
- The "Copy Plot to Clipboard" → "Copy as Metafile" corrupts plot symbols. Save as SVG instead.
:::

## The Solution: Save First, Insert Second

**Never copy-paste!**

::: {.fragment}
Instead:

1. Save plot as file
2. Insert file into PowerPoint
3. Maintain quality

## Vector Formats for PowerPoint

**Three options:**

1. **SVG**: Good support in *modern* PowerPoint → **Use this!**
   - Editable after import
   - Preserves vector format
   - Exports as SVG/PDF maintain vector quality

2. **EMF**: Windows only, obsolete and of no benefit in *newer* PowerPoint. Requires `devEMF`

3. **PDF**: Very poorly supported! Low resolution import (rasterized!) and no editing

4. **PNG**: If you must use raster, then 300+ DPI

## SVG Editing in PowerPoint

## SVG is Editable in PowerPoint

Modern PowerPoint supports SVG editing:

1. Insert SVG file into PowerPoint
2. Right-click → **Ungroup** (or **Convert to Shape**)
3. Individual elements become editable
4. Modify colors, text, positions
5. Compose multi-panel figures
6. Export as SVG/PDF to preserve vector format

**PowerPoint can be your figure composition tool!**

## Ungrouping May Break Complex SVGs

**Be careful when ungrouping:**

- Complex SVGs may lose gradients, patterns, or effects
- Some plot elements might break apart unexpectedly
- Text rendering may change
- Clipping paths may be lost

**Recommendation:**

- Keep a backup copy before ungrouping
- Test with your specific plots first
- For complex figures, consider Inkscape instead if editing is needed.

## Summary

:::{.callout-tip}
## Key Takeaways

1. **Never copy-paste from RStudio** - creates low-resolution bitmaps
2. **Workflow**: Save → Insert
   ```r
   ggsave("plot.png", p, width = 10, height = 6, dpi = 150)
   ```
   Then Insert > Pictures in PowerPoint
3. **Format recommendations for presentations**:
   - **PNG at 150 DPI** - good quality, reasonable file size
   - **SVG** - perfect quality, editable, but larger PowerPoint file
   - **Never JPEG** - lossy compression
4. **SVG in PowerPoint**:
   - Can be ungrouped and edited
   - Text becomes editable
   - Colors/shapes can be changed
   - Warning: complex plots may break when ungrouped
5. **Sizing**:
   - Create plots at ~10 inches width for full-screen slides
   - 6-8 inches for half-screen
   - Match slide aspect ratio (16:9 typically)
6. **Quality hierarchy**: SVG > PNG 150+ DPI > PNG 72 DPI > copy-paste

## Exercises

:::{.callout-note}
## Try It Yourself

1. Create a plot and save two versions:
   ```r
   p <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(mpg, hp, color = factor(cyl))) + geom_point(size = 3)
   ggsave("plot.png", p, width = 10, height = 6, dpi = 150)
   ggsave("plot.svg", p, width = 10, height = 6)
   ```
2. Insert both into PowerPoint and compare quality
3. Try ungrouping the SVG (Right-click > Group > Ungroup)
4. Change the color of one element in the ungrouped SVG
5. Compare file sizes: copy-paste vs PNG vs SVG versions
