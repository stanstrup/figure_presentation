# Welcome {.unnumbered}

This comprehensive guide covers common pitfalls and best practices for creating academic figures, with a focus on R and ggplot2.

## About This Guide

Scientific figures are often the first—and sometimes the only—thing readers look at in a paper. Poor quality figures not only look unprofessional but can also mislead readers and undermine your research. This guide will help you create clear, accurate, and publication-ready figures.

## Three Ways to Learn

This material is available in multiple formats to suit different learning styles:

### 📊 Presentation Slides

Concise, visual presentation format perfect for:

- Quick reference during analysis
- Presentations and workshops
- Getting an overview of key concepts

### 📖 Book Format (You're Here!)

Comprehensive tutorial with the same content plus:
- Detailed introductions and learning objectives
- Summaries and key takeaways
- Hands-on exercises
- Further reading resources

**Note:** This book uses a **single-source architecture**. The same source files (`topics/*.qmd`) generate both the slides and book chapters, ensuring perfect consistency between formats.

### ✅ Interactive Quiz (Local Only)

Test your knowledge with 31 questions covering all topics! The quiz runs as an interactive R Shiny app, so it only works locally (not on the web). See the [Quiz Information appendix](quiz-info.html) for instructions on running it.

**Quiz features:**

- Progressive format (one section at a time)
- Immediate feedback with explanations
- Retry functionality for learning
- Clean, interactive interface

**Quiz content coverage:**

1. **Color Gradients** (7 questions) - Rainbow problems, viridis, colorblindness
2. **Heatmaps** (3 questions) - Outliers, scaling methods
3. **File Formats** (5 questions) - Vector vs raster, photos vs generated plots, DPI
4. **Text Sizing** (2 questions) - Canvas size, base_size
5. **Themes** (2 questions) - theme_set(), ggpubr
6. **Saving Plots** (3 questions) - ggsave(), Cairo devices
7. **Post-Processing** (2 questions) - Reproducibility, metafile issues
8. **Factor Ordering** (3 questions) - Sorting issues, forcats functions
9. **Interactive Plots** (4 questions) - ggplotly, saveWidget, ggiraph

**Running locally:**

```r
# Install learnr if needed
if (!requireNamespace("learnr", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("learnr")
}

# Run the interactive quiz
rmarkdown::run("quiz.Rmd")
```

The quiz will open in your web browser. If you encounter namespace errors, restart your R session and try again.

## What You'll Learn

This guide covers 11 essential topics:

**Core Principles:**

1. **Color Gradients** - Why rainbow scales are problematic and what to use instead
2. **Heatmap Scaling** - Handling outliers and choosing appropriate scaling methods
3. **File Formats** - Vector vs raster, when to use PDF, SVG, PNG, or TIFF

**Practical Workflow:**

4. **Text Sizing** - Making text readable at final dimensions
5. **Themes & Styling** - Setting consistent, publication-ready styles
6. **Saving Plots** - Using ggsave() properly with correct DPI and dimensions
7. **Post-Processing** - When and how to edit exported figures

**Advanced Topics:**

8. **PowerPoint Import** - Importing figures without quality loss
9. **Factor Ordering** - Avoiding common sorting pitfalls
10. **Interactive Plots** - Creating interactive visualizations with plotly
11. **Rendering Issues** - Troubleshooting common problems

## Key Takeaways

## Core Principles to Remember

1. **Colors**: Use viridis family, avoid rainbow
2. **Formats**: Vector (PDF/SVG) for plots, raster (PNG/TIFF) for photos
3. **Sizing**: Use smaller dimensions to make text larger
4. **Saving**: Use `ggsave()` with explicit dimensions and DPI
5. **Reproducibility**: Keep R scripts as source of truth
