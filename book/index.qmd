# Welcome {.unnumbered}

This comprehensive guide covers common pitfalls and best practices for creating academic figures, with a focus on R and ggplot2.

## About This Guide

Scientific figures are often the first—and sometimes the only—thing readers look at in a paper. Poor quality figures not only look unprofessional but can also mislead readers and undermine your research. This guide will help you create clear, accurate, and publication-ready figures.

## What You'll Learn

This guide covers 11 essential topics:

**Core Principles:**

1. **Color Gradients** - Why rainbow scales are problematic and what to use instead
2. **Heatmap Scaling** - Handling outliers and choosing appropriate scaling methods
3. **File Formats** - Vector vs raster, when to use PDF, SVG, PNG, or TIFF

**Practical Workflow:**

4. **Text Sizing** - Making text readable at final dimensions
5. **Themes & Styling** - Setting consistent, publication-ready styles
6. **Saving Plots** - Using ggsave() properly with correct DPI and dimensions
7. **Post-Processing** - When and how to edit exported figures

**Advanced Topics:**

8. **PowerPoint Import** - Importing figures without quality loss
9. **Factor Ordering** - Avoiding common sorting pitfalls
10. **Interactive Plots** - Creating interactive visualizations with plotly
11. **Rendering Issues** - Troubleshooting common problems

## Key Takeaways

## Core Principles to Remember

1. **Colors**: Use viridis family, avoid rainbow
2. **Formats**: Vector (PDF/SVG) for plots, raster (PNG/TIFF) for photos
3. **Sizing**: Use smaller dimensions to make text larger
4. **Saving**: Use `ggsave()` with explicit dimensions and DPI
5. **Reproducibility**: Keep R scripts as source of truth
