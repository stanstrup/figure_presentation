## The Copy-Paste Problem

**What happens when you copy from RStudio:**

::: {.incremental}
- Pastes as low-resolution bitmap
- Looks OK on screen (72 DPI)
- **Terrible when projected**
- Pixelated and blurry
- Doesn't scale well
:::

## The Solution: Save First, Insert Second

**Never copy-paste!**

::: {.fragment}
Instead:

1. Save plot as file
2. Insert file into PowerPoint
3. Maintain quality

## Vector Formats for PowerPoint

**Best option:**

- **SVG**: Good support in *modern* PowerPoint → **Use this!**
- Editable after import
- Preserves vector format
- Exports as SVG/PDF maintain vector quality

**Alternatives:**

- **PNG**: If you must use raster, then 300+ DPI

## SVG Editing in PowerPoint

## SVG is Editable in PowerPoint

Modern PowerPoint supports SVG editing:

1. Insert SVG file into PowerPoint
2. Right-click → **Ungroup** (or **Convert to Shape**)
3. Individual elements become editable
4. Modify colors, text, positions
5. Compose multi-panel figures
6. Export as SVG/PDF to preserve vector format

**PowerPoint can be your figure composition tool!**

## Ungrouping May Break Complex SVGs

**Be careful when ungrouping:**

- Complex SVGs may lose gradients, patterns, or effects
- Some plot elements might break apart unexpectedly
- Text rendering may change
- Clipping paths may be lost

**Recommendation:**

- Keep a backup copy before ungrouping
- Test with your specific plots first
- For complex figures, consider Inkscape instead
